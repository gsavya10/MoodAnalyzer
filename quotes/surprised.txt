Wait long enough, and people will surprise and impress you. 
The moments of happiness we enjoy take us by surprise. It is not that we seize them, but that they seize us.
To be prepared against surprise is to be trained. To be prepared for surprise is to be educated.
The most delightful surprise in life is to suddenly recognise your own worth.
In moments of surprise we catch at least a glimpse of the joy to which gratefulness opens the door. 
Our brightest blazes of gladness are commonly kindled by unexpected sparks. 
In life the only thing that you can expect is the unexpected; the only surprise is a day that has none. 
Surprise comes from defying expectations. 
The only thing that should surprise us is that there are still some things that can surprise us.
The wiser you become, the lesser you will be surprised!
