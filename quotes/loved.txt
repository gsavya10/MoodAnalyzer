The most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love, and to let it come in
Love is a friendship set to music
Be crazy. Be stupid. Be silly. Be weird. Be whatever. Because life is too short to be anything but happy.
Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom.
Happiness isn't what you find at the end of the road. It's right here. Right now.
The secret of being happy is accepting where you are in life and making the most out of everyday.
Love that makes you free to live is going to leave you happy and satisfied so when you find this kind of love, treasure it with all your life because itâ€™s rare.
People seldom understand the secrets of happiness but I think what breeds happiness is an overdose of love from the people you call family.
To be loved is to find happiness in the arms of those you trust and this is the most comforting feeling you could ever have through all the challenges life may throw at you.
Loving with all the strength you can muster, spreading happiness, this is the line between surviving and living.
There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness.
The most desired gift of love is not diamonds or roses or chocolate. It is focused attention.
The art of love is largely the art of persistence
A loving heart is the beginning of all knowledge.
