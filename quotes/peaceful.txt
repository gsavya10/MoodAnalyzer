Try a new belief system, I am a Peaceful Being, now experiment with it, when we experience the result, it is the truth.
If other people are behaving in a reactive manner, at that time for me to remain stable internally, is strength, and hence Peace is strength not weakness.
While working towards our achievements, if we take care not to compromise on our values of peace, love and happiness, then we will be always contented.
When we are peaceful and stable, then we are happy, and we accept others as they are, it means we love them, because love is unconditional acceptance.
When we go for a spiritual retreat, the environment and the people there awaken the same peace and purity in us, but it is our own energy which we have emerged in their company. Now we can create it at home and work. We can't get peace from somewhere; we can learn the art of how to create it.
Your mind is like a magnet. If you think of blessings, you will attract blessings. If you think of problems, you will attract problems. Always think good thoughts and always stay positive.
The life of inner peace, being harmonious and without stress, is the easiest type of existence.
Peace can become a lens through which you see the world. Be it. Live it. Radiate it out. Peace is an inside job. 
When you make peace with yourself, you make peace with the world.
If you are depressed you are living in the past if you are anxious you are living in the future, if you are at peace, you are living in the present. So live in present and love it.
