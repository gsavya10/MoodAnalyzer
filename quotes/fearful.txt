When we compare and compete with others, we create fear, insecurity, jealousy, stress and this depletes our energy. Let us focus only on ourselves and use all our energy to push ourselves forward.
When we set a goal, we visualise the goal. Visualisation enables us to create the right kind of thoughts to achieve the goal. We should not create any thoughts of doubt or fear.
Don't tell God you have a big problem; tell your problem you have a big God.
Happily, I let go of past fears and failures, and I embrace new learning and understanding as I move forwards, towards wisdom. Read through this affirmation.
When we carry pure intentions, create right thoughts and put in sincere efforts, there is no reason to fear. Thoughts of faith in the self and in people working with us finish the fear.
Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.
Courage is not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid but he who conquers that fear.
Above all, don't fear difficult moments. The best comes from them.
Ultimately we know deeply that the other side of every fear is a freedom. So choose freedom over fear!!
To be brave is the gift given by the fear. So be brave enough to let the fear go off your mind!!
