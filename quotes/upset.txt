Life is meant to be enjoyed, and to live life the fullest you must always look at the bright side. The cup isn’t half empty, it’s half full!
Learning to shape your perspective positively has the power to transform not only your mindset, but the whole world around you.
Positivity is a choice, and we promise that it’s one you’ll never live to regret.
Being happy and content is the primary human goal. Nothing in life is better than finding the source of perpetual happiness.
Don’t rely on someone else for your happiness and self-worth. Only you can be responsible for that. If you can’t love and respect yourself – no one else will be able to make that happen. Accept who you are – completely; the good and the bad – and make changes as YOU see fit – not because you think someone else wants you to be different.
There is only one way to happiness and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power of our will.
Now and then it’s good to pause in our pursuit of happiness and just be happy.
Keep your face always toward the sunshine—and shadows will fall behind you.
Train your mind to see the good in every situation.
Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.
Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things.
Cherish your yesterdays, dream your tomorrows and live your todays.
The purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience.
It's OK to not be OK. It's not OK to not ask someone to back you up.
A smile is the most attractive thing you can wear. 
Everyone in life is gonna hurt you; you just have to figure out which people are worth the pain
