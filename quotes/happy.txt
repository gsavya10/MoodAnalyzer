The true secret of happiness lies in the taking a genuine interest in all the details of daily life.
The greatest happiness you can have is knowing that you do not necessarily require happiness
People should find happiness in the little things, like family.
Happiness depends upon ourselves.
All happiness or unhappiness solely depends upon the quality of the object to which we are attached by love.
A great obstacle to happiness is to expect too much happiness.
The secret of happiness is freedom, the secret of freedom is courage.
It is how much we have,but how much we enjoy,that makes happiness.
There is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow creatures, and feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.
We can't control the world. We can only (barely) control our own reactions to it. Happiness is largely a choice, not a right or entitlement.
