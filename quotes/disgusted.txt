Disgust is a learned behaviour that finds fertile soil in ignorance, yielding a bountiful harvest of alienation, oppression, and hate.
Some people are just beautifully wrapped boxes of shit.
You can't change someone who doesn't see an issue in their actions.
Avoid people that make you feel disgust.
If someone can make you feel disgusted one day and absolutely joyous the other day,then you are more atached than you think.
All is disgust when a man leaves his own nature and soes what is unfit.
Disgust and Resolve are two of the great emotions that lead to change.
No matter hw badly someone treats you,never drop down to their level.Remain calm,stay strong and walk away.
I used to be disgusted ,now I try to be amused.
It's okay to walk out of someone's life,if you don't feel like you belong to it anymore.
