Explain your anger, don't express it, & you will immediately open the door to solutions instead of arguments.
We always thought that anger internal is natural, so we created external measures to postpone our reactions. If we take care of our thoughts, we will not create even the thoughts of anger.
No one is responsible for my hurt, pain, fear or anger. It is my own creation in response to their behaviour. I have another choice of being joyful, blissful, and happy.
Every time we use anger as the tool, we experience the negative energy as we give it to them. They get hurt and their vibrations travel to us. So we get more than we give.
The mind does not understand the language of opposites. If we create a thought - I should not get angry - the scene that gets created is of anger. Instead create the thought - I am a peaceful being, and visualise the scene of being at peace in every situation.
Situations today may not be my way. People today may not behave the way I would like them to be. Nothing may be going right. I will be stable and calm today. My state of mind does not depend on people and situations.
The quicker a person forgives other people for mistakes the sooner a person moves forward to live their own life free of disabling anger, resentment, bitterness, and regret.
Sometimes things are far less complicated than we make them out to be. So think twice before we respond to a situation.
Successful relations don't depend on how good understanding we have. But it depends on how nicely we avoid misunderstanding.
95% problems of life are due to the tone of voice. It's not what we say, it's how we say. Just change the tone & see the change in life.
Do not make your emotion your identity. I am sad, I am aggressive, I am impatient, I am irritated, I am frustrated, I am guilty. Emotion is only a creation, it will pass. I am is an Affirmation.I am _________ what you put there creates your reality.
